            Rava Bonda is quick , tasty and yummy snack that anyone can do when children ask any snacks in the house. Idli rava is one of the most common ingredient in most of the Indian Pantry. A very handy ingredient especially to make an evening snack. Rava Ildi , Uttappam are some of the recipes that we all make frequently. For the most of the conventional recipes  where we use dal or rice, we can substitute with Rava and make it instantly. This Rava Bonda is also a quick and yummy bonda with which we can impress our guests and also our kids in no time if we have all ingredients handy.
