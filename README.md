                              RAVA BONDA
                              
            Rava Bonda(Sooji Bonda) is quick and instant snack anyone can do when there are any unexpected visitors/relatives in our house. Sooji is one of the most common ingredient in most of the Indian Pantry. A very handy ingredient especially to make something immediately and quickly. Rava Upma, Rava Payasam, Rava Paniyaram, Rava Ildi, Rava Dosa are some of the recipes that we all make frequently. For the most of the conventional recipes  where we use dal or rice, we can substitute with Rava and make it instantly. This Rava Bonda (Sooji Bonda) is also a quick and yummy bonda with which we can impress our guests and also our kids in no time!
